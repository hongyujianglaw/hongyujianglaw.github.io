        <h1>Knowing When to Speak: Teamwork in Difficult Moments</h1>
        <p class="meta">Collaboration · Reflection</p>

        <h2>When speaking up is part of the team’s responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          During my GDL, I took part in <em>A Race for Justice</em>, a charity that delivers interactive workshops on race and discrimination. These sessions
          are designed not to lecture, but to create space for honest questions and constructive dialogue, even when topics feel uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work itself was highly collaborative. Our team was made up of students from very different backgrounds, and we worked entirely online. We had
          clear roles, shared timelines, and a strong sense of collective responsibility. Each of us was accountable for our own section, but we also reviewed
          one another’s content to ensure consistency, clarity, and a respectful tone for a public audience.
        </p>

        <h2>My role and the challenge it carried</h2>
        <p>
          I was responsible for part of the session on terminology and microaggressions. This role required not only accuracy, but judgement. Our aim was not to
          overwhelm participants with definitions, but to give them language that would help them recognise indirect discrimination in everyday situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, we talked openly as a team about the fact that sensitive moments could still arise, even in informed and well-intentioned spaces.
          Discomfort, we agreed, was not a sign of failure, but part of the learning process.
        </p>

        <h2>The moment that tested us</h2>
        <p>
          While we were discussing examples of microaggressions, a teammate asked me why some Asian people use very pale foundation, suggesting it might be about
          wanting to look white. The question was not hostile, but despite the training we had all received, it still landed with a subtle sense of discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that moment, I was aware of two things at once. First, staying silent would allow an assumption to pass unexamined. Second, responding sharply could
          easily shut down the conversation and undermine the trust within the team. Speaking up, if I chose to do so, needed to serve the group rather than
          escalate the moment.
        </p>

        <h2>Answering with context</h2>
        <p>
          To keep the discussion constructive, I explained that Asia is vast, with enormous cultural and historical diversity, stretching from regions near
          Russia to areas close to the equator. As with many regions of the world, skin tone varies in part with latitude: populations living at higher latitudes
          tend to have lighter skin, while those closer to the equator tend to have darker skin. This variation is linked to melanin production, a biological
          mechanism that helps protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then added that, in parts of East Asia, long-standing ideas of beauty developed within this environmental and cultural context. Historical literature
          and art often celebrated luminous skin, red lips, white teeth, and dark hair as signs of health, vitality, and refinement. These ideals emerged
          centuries before modern racial categories existed and were not framed in relation to racial hierarchy. Seen this way, such aesthetic preferences
          reflect historical and environmental influences rather than an aspiration to resemble another racial group.
        </p>

        <h2>Why it mattered</h2>
        <p>
          As I spoke, the tone of the conversation shifted. The question moved from assumption to context. My teammate listened carefully and said he had never
          considered it from that perspective before. The group remained engaged, and the discussion returned naturally to our shared task of building a
          responsible and inclusive workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          What stayed with me was not the question itself, but the balance that moment required. Speaking up was not about correcting someone for the sake of
          being right. It was about protecting the purpose of the team’s work. By addressing the comment calmly and clearly, I was able to support both the
          individual conversation and the collective goal.
        </p>

        <h2>What teamwork now means to me</h2>
        <p>
          This experience reinforced my understanding of teamwork in public-facing work. Collaboration does not mean avoiding difficult moments. It means
          recognising when it is necessary to speak, and doing so in a way that strengthens trust rather than undermines it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anti-discrimination training does not eliminate discomfort entirely. What it does is equip teams with the tools to handle it together. For me, that
          means being willing to speak when something feels off, while staying focused on the wider responsibility we share.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is not about presenting myself as unaffected or confrontational. It is a record of how I am learning to work within teams, speak up when
          needed, and help maintain constructive dialogue in spaces where differences are real and conversations matter.
