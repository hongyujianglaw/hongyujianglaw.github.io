        <h1>From zero to £1,673: learning a legal process as an outsider</h1>
        <p class="meta">Case study · March 2025</p>
        <p>
          Getting a tenancy deposit back in the UK can be frustrating, especially for international students. The amount is often too large to ignore, but too
          small to justify paying a lawyer. When you are preparing to leave the country and the landlord or agent stops responding, many people simply accept
          the loss. That was almost my situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My deposit remained in the Deposit Protection Service (DPS) long enough to earn interest, yet it was not returned. After repeated delays and no
          meaningful response from the managing agent, I decided to begin a formal deposit claim. This post is a practical record of that process and how the
          system works in practice.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Check where your deposit is protected</h3>
        <p>In England, landlords must protect tenancy deposits using one of the approved schemes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deposit Protection Service (DPS)</li>
          <li>MyDeposits</li>
          <li>Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tenants should receive written confirmation when the tenancy begins.</p>
        <p>
          If a landlord fails to protect the deposit within the required time, the tenant may apply directly to court, and the landlord can be ordered to pay
          compensation of up to three times the deposit. In my case, the deposit was protected under DPS, so I used its dispute process.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Communicate clearly with the landlord or agent</h3>
        <p>Before starting a formal claim, it is important to try to resolve the issue directly.</p>
        <p>
          In most cases, a landlord may deduct from a deposit only for limited reasons: damage beyond fair wear and tear, unpaid rent, or failure to give proper
          notice. Most disputes relate to alleged damage.
        </p>
        <p>At this stage, all communication should be in writing. Email is the most reliable option. I focused on three points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Condition at check-in.</strong> I confirmed issues that already existed when I moved in, supported by photographs.</li>
          <li><strong>Condition at check-out.</strong> I showed that the property was left in a condition no worse than at the start of the tenancy.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasons for deductions.</strong> I asked the agent to provide itemised reasons, photographs, and receipts showing actual costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Emails from platforms such as Gmail can be downloaded as PDF files and later uploaded as evidence.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Use the free dispute service</h3>
        <p>When communication failed, I used the free dispute resolution service provided by DPS. The process has three stages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Initial submissions.</strong> Both sides state the amount in dispute. Any undisputed amount is returned first.</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence submission.</strong> Each party uploads evidence independently. You can only see your own submissions, and multiple uploads are allowed.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjudication.</strong> An independent adjudicator reviews the materials and issues a decision, usually within one to two weeks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In many cases, the dispute is resolved at this stage without court proceedings.</p>

        <h3>What actually made a difference</h3>
        <p>Two factors mattered most.</p>
        <p>I kept all written explanations short and factual. I stated that reasonable attempts had been made to resolve the issue, but no agreement was reached.</p>
        <p>
          I also learned that personal statements are part of the evidence. Not every point must be proven by photographs or documents alone. In my case, I
          explained that I would not have agreed to sign the tenancy if the agent had not verbally confirmed that existing wall marks and stains would not fall
          within chargeable deductions. This explanation helped establish the context in which the contract was agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While verbal assurances are not always documented, explaining how they influenced the decision to enter the tenancy formed part of a wider and
          coherent evidence chain. It supported the argument that the later deductions were inconsistent with the understanding at the time of agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>My key evidence</h3>
        <p>
          Photographs taken at check-in were critical. I submitted 34 photos showing stains, marks, and cleanliness issues already present before occupation.
          These images also supported the point that the property did not meet a higher standard at the start of the tenancy than at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Email correspondence mattered just as much. I downloaded emails as PDFs and renamed them clearly, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check-in condition and photos</li>
          <li>Agent acknowledgement of reported issues</li>
          <li>Check-out inspection and proposed deductions</li>
          <li>Request for receipts and supporting evidence</li>
          <li>Agent refusal to provide evidence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clear file names helped the adjudicator understand the timeline quickly.</p>

        <h3>The outcome</h3>
        <p>About one week after the evidence stage closed, DPS returned the full disputed deposit, totalling £1,673.</p>
        <p>
          Although the outcome was positive, the process was time-consuming and required patience and organisation. It is not an experience I would wish to
          repeat. However, it demonstrated that the system does work when evidence is structured and arguments are presented within the framework of the scheme.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned as an international student</h3>
        <p>I am an international student, and I have studied law. Even so, I had to learn the UK deposit system from zero.</p>
        <p>
          Legal training helped me organise information, but it did not remove the feeling of being unfamiliar with the system. I still had to learn new
          procedures, terminology, and expectations that are often assumed to be common knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience made it clear to me that many UK residents without legal training, and many international students from minority communities, may
          face similar or greater barriers. The issue is often not a lack of rights, but a lack of accessible knowledge and confidence to use them.
        </p>

        <h3>Where to seek help</h3>
        <p>This post is shared as a practical record, not as legal advice.</p>
        <p>
          Navigating UK legal and regulatory systems can be challenging, particularly for those unfamiliar with them. Access to justice often depends on
          understanding how to use existing processes, rather than on the rights themselves. If you are facing a similar issue, you may wish to seek
          independent support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organisations such as Citizens Advice and Shelter provide free and reliable guidance and can help you understand your options. If you would like to
          discuss the process at a general level, or to better understand how deposit protection schemes work in practice, you are welcome to contact me. While
          I cannot provide legal advice, I am happy to share practical experience and signpost appropriate sources of help.
